A ML model prediction that estimates the quantity and quality of the cement that goes into production with certain attributes.  This uses three methods: least square model, particle swarm optimization and gradient descent.  The data was taken from here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Slump+Test.
